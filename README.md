## üß≠ UX/UI Design Process

### 1. UX Workflow
- **Wireframing:** Started with a simple wireframe to define the card‚Äôs essential information, grouping, and reading order for clarity and ease of use.
- **Dynamic Information:** The UI adapts based on the robot‚Äôs status (e.g., delivery details appear only when status is "On Delivery").
- **Action Controls:** The "Return to Base" button is enabled only when the robot is Idle or On Delivery, preventing invalid actions.
- **Responsive Layout:** Designed for both mobile and desktop, ensuring a consistent and accessible experience across all devices.

### 2. UI Workflow
- **Light & Dark Modes:** Created both light and dark themes for desktop and mobile, maintaining clear visual hierarchy and optimal contrast.
- **Color System:** Used Figma color variables for all states and elements, ensuring:
  - Efficiency: Change a color once, update everywhere.
  - Consistency: Clean, professional, and coherent visual identity.
  - Scalability: Ready for large teams and evolving projects.
- **Status Colors:**
  - On Delivery: Blue (active, stable)
  - Idle: Gray (standby)
  - Returning: Purple (transitioning)
  - Error: Red (critical)
  - Order ID / ETA: Orange (delivery focus)
- **Battery Colors:**
  - High: Green (optimal)
  - Warning: Orange (medium, monitor)
  - Low: Red (critical, urgent)
- **Battery Bar:** A colored progress bar visually indicates battery level for quick assessment.

### 3. Design Principles
- **UX-first, UI-second:** The process started from real user needs, resulting in a clean, intuitive, and developer-friendly interface.
- **Modular & Scalable:** The design is modular, adaptable, and ready for integration into real-world robot monitoring systems.
